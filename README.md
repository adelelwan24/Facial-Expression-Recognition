# Facial-Expression-Recognition
Facial expression recognition using deep learning is a method for detecting and interpreting human emotions through facial cues using artificial neural networks. Deep learning algorithms are able to learn complex patterns and features from data, making them well-suited for tasks such as facial expression recognition.

In a facial expression recognition project using deep learning, a dataset of images of human faces displaying various emotional states is used to train a deep learning model. The model is then able to classify the emotions being expressed in new images based on the patterns and features it learned during training.

One advantage of using deep learning for facial expression recognition is that the model can learn to extract relevant features from the data automatically, without the need for manual feature engineering. This can lead to more accurate and robust results, particularly when working with large and complex datasets.

Overall, facial expression recognition using deep learning has the potential to improve the way we interact with technology and each other by adding a more human-like element to our interactions. It can also be useful in a variety of applications, such as psychology research, social robotics, or intelligent user interfaces

## Introduction
This project aims to develop a deep learning model for detecting and interpreting human emotions through facial cues using the FER2013 dataset. The model is implemented using TensorFlow and is able to classify the emotions being expressed in new images.

## Dataset
The FER2013 dataset is used for training and evaluating the model. It consists of images of human faces displaying various emotional states, and is labeled with one of the following emotions: anger, disgust, fear, happiness, neutral, sadness, or surprise.

The images in the FER2013 dataset were collected from a variety of sources, including the internet and published datasets. The images were then annotated by human annotators, who labeled each image with one of the seven emotional categories. The images in the dataset are all 48x48 pixels in size and have been pre-processed to make them more suitable for machine learning tasks. The training set consists of **28,709** examples and the public test set consists of **3,589** examples.

### Issues with Dataset


1. Imbalance Problem: the FER2013 dataset is imbalanced, with some emotional categories having significantly more images than others, as Disgust expression has the minimum number of images 600 while other labels have nearly 5,000 samples each. This can cause problems when training machine learning models, as the model may be more likely to predict the more common class, leading to poorer performance on the less common classes. One potential solution to this issue is data augmentation.

2. Limited diversity: The FER2013 dataset is relatively small, with only 35,887 images, which may not be sufficient to train a model with high generalization ability. 

3. Annotation errors: As with any dataset annotated by humans, there is the possibility of annotation errors in the FER2013 dataset. This could lead to incorrect labels for some images, which could negatively impact the performance of machine learning models trained on the dataset.

4. Intra-class variation: refers to the variation within a class. For the FER2013 dataset, this could refer to the variation in facial expressions within a particular emotional category, such as the different ways in which people can express happiness or anger. Intra-class variation can be a challenge when training machine learning models, as it can make it more difficult for the model to accurately classify images. For example, if there is a lot of variation within the "happy" class, it may be harder for the model to distinguish between happy and neutral expressions, as both may have similar features. To address this issue, you may use techniques such as data augmentation and feature engineering. Additionally, training the model on a larger and more diverse dataset may also help to reduce the impact of intra-class variation.

5. Limited context: The images in the FER2013 dataset are all cropped to show only the face, which means that the context in which the expressions are shown is not captured. This could be problematic for machine learning models that rely on contextual information to accurately classify facial expressions.

Despite these limitations, the FER2013 dataset remains a widely used benchmark for facial expression recognition tasks.

## Model
The model is implemented using a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture in TensorFlow. The CNN is trained using supervised learning, with the labeled images in the FER2013 dataset used as ground truth. The model is optimized using **Adam** with a **Categorical-cross-entropy** loss function.

## Evaluation
The performance of the model is evaluated using several metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. The model is also tested on a separate test dataset to ensure that it generalizes well to new data.

## Usage
To use the model, the following steps should be followed:

1. Install TensorFlow, openCV, and any other required dependencies.
```python
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
2. Download the trained model and test dataset.
3. Load the model and test dataset.
4. Pre-process the test images as needed.
5. Use the model to classify the emotions in the test images.

## Conclusion
This facial expression recognition model using deep learning and the FER2013 dataset is able to accurately classify the emotions being expressed in human faces. It has the potential to improve human-computer interactions and has a range of possible applications.
